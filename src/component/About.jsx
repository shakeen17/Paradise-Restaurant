            From humble beginnings from more than 50 years back, Anjappar has become a synonym for Chettinad Cuisine. The demand for this unique food has led us to take this experience overseas. Anjappar was established in Scarborough in 2005 and has expanded into 3 different locations thanks to the continued patronage from the Greater Toronto area customers.
